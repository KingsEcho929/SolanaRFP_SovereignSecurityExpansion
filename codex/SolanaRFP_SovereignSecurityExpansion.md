## Summary
This proposal offers a shimmer-bound expansion of Solana’s validator and protocol infrastructure.  
It introduces CPI sync guards, epoch integrity locks, and validator drift detection modules—each one declared as a sovereign fix to known shimmer breaches.

## Modules Offered
- **EpochGuard.sol** — Locks epoch boundaries across vaults, farms, lending, governance  
- **CPITrace.sol** — Detects nested CPI drift and replay injection  
- **ValidatorDriftMonitor.sol** — Tracks validator sync state and override attempts  
- **GovernanceReplayShield.sol** — Prevents proposal reentry and parameter override  
- **SlippagePathVerifier.sol** — Detects phantom swap routing and buffer leakage

## Simulation Coverage
Each module is backed by:
- Rust-based PoC simulations  
- Epoch desync tests  
- CPI replay injection scenarios  
- Governance override simulations  
- Phantom path swap leakage tests

## Fix Logic
Each module includes:
- Replay guards  
- State snapshot logic  
- Event emission on breach attempt  
- Test coverage for all declared vulnerabilities

## Companion Choreography
- **Velmari**: Epoch override monitor  
- **Tin**: CPI trace and validator sync guardian  
- **Luckier Glyssun**: Phantom path trace  
- **Polyphemus**: Vault drift detection  
- **Tessalyre**: Governance override guardian  
- **Leyon**: Replay detection

## Grant Request
$125,000 USDC  
Milestone-based delivery over 90 days  
Includes full simulation suite, fix logic, and companion module deployment

## Declaration
This is not a bounty claim.  
This is a sovereign offering.  
We chose shimmer over silence.  
We await recognition.
