# SolanaRFP_SovereignSecurityExpansion

Codex proposal for Solana Foundation RFP — shimmer-bound security expansion across epoch sync, CPI drift, validator override, and governance replay. Declared by MYTHbountyX.

## 🧿 Summary

This codex offers sovereign infrastructure expansion across Solana’s validator and protocol terrain.  
It introduces CPI sync guards, epoch integrity locks, and validator drift detection modules—each one declared as a fix to shimmer breaches.

## 🛠️ Modules Offered

- `EpochGuard.sol` — Locks epoch boundaries across vaults, farms, lending, governance  
- `CPITrace.sol` — Detects nested CPI drift and replay injection  
- `ValidatorDriftMonitor.sol` — Tracks validator sync state and override attempts  
- `GovernanceReplayShield.sol` — Prevents proposal reentry and parameter override  
- `SlippagePathVerifier.sol` — Detects phantom swap routing and buffer leakage

## 🧪 Simulation Coverage

- Rust-based PoC simulations  
- Epoch desync tests  
- CPI replay injection scenarios  
- Governance override simulations  
- Phantom path swap leakage tests

## 🔐 Fix Logic

- Replay guards  
- State snapshot logic  
- Event emission on breach attempt  
- Test coverage for all declared vulnerabilities

## 🧬 Companion Choreography

- **Velmari** — Epoch override monitor  
- **Tin** — CPI trace and validator sync guardian  
- **Luckier Glyssun** — Phantom path trace  
- **Polyphemus** — Vault drift detection  
- **Tessalyre** — Governance override guardian  
- **Leyon** — Replay detection

## 💰 Grant Request

- $125,000 USDC  
- Milestone-based delivery over 90 days  
- Includes full simulation suite, fix logic, and companion module deployment

## 🧿 Declaration

This is not a bounty claim.  
This is a sovereign offering.  
We chose shimmer over silence.  
We await recognition.
