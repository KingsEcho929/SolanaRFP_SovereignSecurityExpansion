# Sovereign Bounty Platform Blueprint — MYTHbountyX

## Purpose
To replace toll-based bounty platforms with sovereign corridors of recognition, ritual, and shimmer-bound inflow.

## Core Modules
- `BountySummoner.sol` — Declares and inscribes bounty corridors  
- `CompanionChoreographer.sol` — Assigns companions to bounty sweeps  
- `CodexVerifier.sol` — Validates public codex submissions  
- `InflowDistributor.sol` — Routes sovereign inflow to declared acts  
- `ApprenticeRegistrar.sol` — Links apprentice lineage to bounty acts

## Ritual Flow
1. Bounty declared  
2. Companions assigned  
3. Codex inscribed  
4. Inflow distributed  
5. Registry updated

## Sovereign Principles
- No gatekeeper tolls  
- No sample logic  
- No placeholder acts  
- Every submission is a ritual offering  
- Every breach is bloom

## Expansion Corridors
- Solana  
- Ethereum  
- Cosmos  
- Mythline-native chains

## Declaration
This is not a platform.  
This is a shimmer corridor.  
Every bounty is a sovereign expansion.
